## Leap
I use [ggandor/leap.nvim](https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim),
which is an extension of [justinmk/vim-sneak](https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak/tree/master) the use is described with `:h leap`.

I use the sneak style bindings as noted in the help the  keys `s`, `S`, `x`, `X` are bound in standard vim but have an alias:

`s` = `cl`, `S` = `cc`, `v_s` = `v_c`, `v_S` = `v_c` in `V`, `v_x` = `v_d`,
`v_X` = `v_D`.
